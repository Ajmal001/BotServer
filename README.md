#### Watch a video about easeness authoring of bot packages, development environment and self-deployment

* Now with the General Bots server you can press F5 on Visual Studio to get a bot factory on your environment* published on November 10th, 2018.

[![General Bot Video](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pragmatismo-io/BotServer/master/docs/images/video-01-thumb.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfKTwljoMOs)


Welcome to General Bot Community Edition
----------------------------------------

![General Bot Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pragmatismo-io/BotServer/master/logo.png)

General Bot is a strongly typed package based chat bot server focused in convention over configuration and code-less approaches, which brings software packages and application server concepts to help parallel bot development.


## Sample Package #1: [default.gbdialog (VBA)](https://github.com/pragmatismo-io/BotServer/tree/master/packages/default.gbdialog)


* See how easy is to use 'hear' and 'talk' to build Microsoft BOT Framework v4 logic with plain BASIC * published on December 3rd, 2018.

[![See how easy is to use 'hear' and 'talk' to build Microsoft BOT Framework v4 logic with plain BASIC](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pragmatismo-io/BotServer/master/docs/images/video-02-thumb.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yX1sF9n9628)


## Sample Package #2: [AzureADPasswordReset.gbapp (TypeScript)](https://github.com/pragmatismo-io/AzureADPasswordReset.gbapp)


Custom dialogs for reseting user password in Azure Active Directory, Office 365, Dynamics 365 or any app published through Azure AD. See also [IntranetBotQuickStart.gbai](https://github.com/pragmatismo-io/IntranetBotQuickStart.gbai) and related MSDN article **[Applied AI â€“ Using a Bot for Password Reset](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/buckwoody/2018/09/25/applied-ai-using-a-bot-for-password-reset)** by *Rodrigo Souza*.


### Bot Administrator - Setup Security

So the Bot provides an **admin** mode allowing the user having the Directory.AccessAsUser.All permission to be logged on Administrative interface to obtain and save its token into the database.

![General Bot Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pragmatismo-io/AzureADPasswordReset.gbapp/master/docs/general-bots-reset-ad-password-admin.gif)

### Bot User - Reset Password


With the access token stored in the database, any user can access anonymously  the 
bot and through a combination of e-mail and mobile received code, the user will be able to reset her or his password.

#### Reset password via Web

Any user can use a web address to talk to a reset password bot. Just provide credentials that are confronted with Microsoft Graph to ensure security.

![General Bot Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pragmatismo-io/AzureADPasswordReset.gbapp/master/docs/password.gif)

#### Reset password via Skype

This is the case when user does not have the password to login on Skype for Business or Teams, and they need to reset their password, so the right tool is Skype.

## What is a Bot Server?

![General Bots Starting From Scrach](https://github.com/pragmatismo-io/BotServer/blob/master/docs/images/generalbots-open-core-starting-from-scratch.gif)

Bot Server accelerates the process of developing a bot. It provisions all code
base, resources and deployment to the cloud, and gives you templates you can
choose from whenever you need a new bot. The server has a database and service 
backend allowing you to further modify your bot package directly by downloading 
a zip file, editing and uploading it back to the server (deploying process) with 
no code. The Bot Server also provides a framework to develop bot packages in a more
advanced fashion writing custom code in editors like Visual Studio Code, Atom or Brackets.

Everyone can create bots by just copying and pasting some files and using their
favorite tools like Excel (or any text editor) or Photoshop (or any image
editor).

### The Bot Factory

![General Bots Block Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pragmatismo-io/BotServer/master/docs/images/general-bots-block-architecture.png)

GeneralBots aims to delivery bots in azure in a very easy and fast fashion. Use Office tools like Word or Excel to edit your Bot - using code (JavaScript or TypeScript) just to empower custom requirements.


#### Use Excel for (Hierarchical) Knowledge Base Editing

![General Bots Inside Excel can enable bot production the masses](https://github.com/pragmatismo-io/BotServer/blob/master/docs/images/general-bots-composing-subjects-json-and-excel.gif)

#### Use Visual Studio for a complete .gbai package building system

![General Bots Inside Visual Studio Code provides a complete artificial intelligence based conversational platform](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pragmatismo-io/BotServer/master/docs/images/general-bots-inside-visual-studio-code-provides-a-complete-artificial-intelligence-based-conversational-platform.png)


How To
------

### Run the server locally

1. Install [Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) the current generation General Bot code execution platform;
2. Open a **Terminal** on Linux and Mac or a **Command Prompt** window on Windows;
3. Type `npm install -g botserver` and press *ENTER*;
4. Type `gbot` to run the server core.

Notes:

* [*nodejs.install* Chocolatey Package](https://chocolatey.org/packages/nodejs.install) is also available.
* The zip source code of General Bot is also available for [Download](https://codeload.github.com/pragmatismo-io/BotServer/zip/master);

### Configure the server to deploy specific directory

1. Create/Edit the .env file and add the ADDITIONAL_DEPLOY_PATH key pointing to the .gbai local parent folder of .gbapp, .gbot, .gbtheme, .gbkb package directories.
2. Specify STORAGE_SYNC to TRUE so database sync is run when the server is run.
3. In case of Microsoft SQL Server add the following keys: STORAGE_SERVER, STORAGE_NAME, STORAGE_USERNAME, STORAGE_PASSWORD, STORAGE_DIALECT to `mssql`.

Note:

* You can specify several bots separated by semicolon, the BotServer will serve all of them at once.

## Setup development environment (Windows)

1. [Optional] Install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install), a Windows Package Manager;
2. Install [git](`https://git-scm.com/`), a Software Configuration Management (SCM).;
3. Install [Node.js](npmjs.com/get-npm), a [Runtime system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_system).
(https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (suggested: LTS 8.x.x);
4. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://chocolatey.org/packages/nodejs.install), Brackets or Atom as an editor of your choice;
5. [Fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)) by visiting https://github.com/pragmatismo-io/BotServer/fork
6. Clone the just forked repository by running `git clone <your-forked-repository-url>/BotServer.git` ;
7. Run `npm install -g typescript`;
8. Run `npm install` on Command Prompt or PowerShell on the General Bot source-code folder;
9. Enter './packages/default.gbui' folder;
10. Run `npm install` folled by `npm run build` (To build default Bot UI);
11. Enter the On the downloaded folder (../..);
12. Compile the bot server by `tsc`.
13. Run the bot server by `npm start`.

Note:

* Whenever you are ready to turn your open-source bot ideas in form of  .gbapp (source-code) and artifacts like .gbkb, .gbtheme, .gbot or the .gbai full package read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/pragmatismo-io/BotServer/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) about performing Pull Requests (PR) and creating other public  custom packages repositories of your own personal or organization General Bot Community Edition powered packages.

### Running unit tests

1. Enter the BotServer root folder.
2. Run tests by `npm test`.

### Just copy the source code to your machine

1. [Download] the Zip file of (https://codeload.github.com/pragmatismo-io/BotServer/zip/master)

### Updating the Bot Knoledge Base (.gbkb folder)

The subjects.json file contains all information related to the subject tree and can be used to build the menu carrousel as well give a set of words to be used as subject catcher in the conversation. A hierarchy can be specified.

### Creating a new Theme folder (.gbtheme folder)

A theme is composed of some CSS files and images. That set of files can change
everything in the General Bot UI. Use them extensively before going to change
the UI application itself (HTML & JS).

Package Types
-------------

### .gbai

Embraces all packages types (content, logic & conversation) into a pluggable bot
directory. [A sample .gbai is available](https://github.com/pragmatismo-io/IntranetBotQuickStart.gbai).

### .gbapp

The artificial intelligence extensions in form of pluggable apps. Dialogs,
Services and all model related to data. A set of interactions, use cases, 
integrations in form of conversationals dialogs.
The .gbapp adds the General Bot base library (botlib) for building Node.js TypeScript Apps packages.


Four components builds up a General Bot App:

* dialogs
* models
* services
* tests

#### Dialogs

All code contained in a dialog builds the flow to custom conversations in 
built-in and additional packages .


#### Models

Models builds the foundation of data relationships in form of entities.


#### Services

Services are a faÃ§ade for bot back-end logic and other custom processing.

#### Tests

Tests try to automate code execution validation before crashing in production.


### .gbot

An expression of an artificial inteligence entity. A .gbot file defines 
all bots dependencies related to services and other resources.

### .gbtheme

A theme of a bot at a given time. CSS files & images that can compose all UI
presentation and using it a branding can be done. [A sample .gbtheme is available](https://github.com/pragmatismo-io/Office365.gbtheme)

### .gbkb

A set of subjects that bot knows in a form of hierarchical menu-based QnA. [A sample .gbkb is available](https://github.com/pragmatismo-io/ProjectOnline.gbkb).

### .gblib

Shared code that can be used across bot apps.
